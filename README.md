### Modules

#### Computer Vision Models

Process data from cameras mounted on billboard structures for real-time analytics

> Using gaze detection for precisice impression data including duration of customer engagements

> Using object detection of vehicles to track demographics

> Using Scene Text Detection and Recognition to extract licence plate data

> Tracking weather patterns and other seasonal trends per structure location

> Proof of Posting (PoP) with Vision Language Model Quality Control alerts for damaged or improperly deployed vynals.

#### Knowledge Graph Onlology

Create a visual representation of all structures for a market and connecting geospatial, entity relationships, and advertising campaign optomization for each client's unique needs.

> Palantir AIP Ondology SDK used to track the relationship between Billboard structures, client locations, campaign locations, campaign durations, and topological/traffic map data.

### Hardware

*We are currently testing some diferent off-the-shelf hardware solutions, but will be building our own solution for real-world deployment.*
